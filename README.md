CLTFC Shots on Target Against Analysis
Performance & Defensive Analysis – Charlotte FC Academy (2025)

This project is a video-driven defensive analysis conducted during my internship with the Charlotte FC Academy as a Performance (Data) Analyst.
The analysis focuses on all shots on target conceded across 17 defensive clips and evaluates:

1. Method of Attack

How opponents created their shots on target (e.g., 1v1s, through balls, low crosses, set pieces, dribble actions).

2. Defensive Density

Number of players between the ball and goal when the shot occurred.

3. Mistake-Driven Shots

Which defensive errors (lost markers, poor positioning, failed duels, clearances, etc.) contributed directly to shots on target.
